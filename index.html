      <p>This website is intended to eventually replace (and be better than) the website currently at <a href="http://www.rabbitsguides.com" target="_blank">www.rabbitsguides.com</a> with my own code (instead of using a template which I downloaded off of the internet which I don't really understand)!

        <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/kids/books" target="_blank">Lonely Planet for Kids</a>
        <p>I like the simplicity of the Lonely Planet page for kids books. Similar to my idea, the landing page will simply consist of a list of books on offer. I like that they have the filter options for age groups, but this will not be relevant for Rabbit Guides in the immediate future since only two books have been published so far.</p>
        <p>Technically speaking I'm curious as to why there is scripting coded directly into the html file and why the designer of the site did not utilize a separate script file. I'm also wondering why the html uses h6 headers but does not seem to have h3 or other headers before h6. Each book image is held in a div within a div. The first div seems to define the column spacing and the second div defines aspects surrounding the deatils of the book (containing the image and description).</p>
        <p>As far as elements I don't recognize, when it comes down to the actual html, it seems to be quite simple and I recognize the html elements used. I would like to learn more about the metadata that can be added to pages in the html header.</p>
